# Arduino Projects

This repository contains code and documentation for some of my Arduino projects.
Some of the projects are still work in progress and I will try to update the documentation as it goes.

- **Hicking Tracker (work in progress):** A hicking tracker aimed to be worn on a belt equipped with GPS, temperature sensor, compass, etc.
The data for the trek is stored on a SD card to be visualized later.
